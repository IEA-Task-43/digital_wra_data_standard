# Digital WRA Data Standards

This repository is for the work, carried out by IEA Wind Task 43, on standardizing digital tools in wind resource 
assessment (WRA). It currently consists of data models for wind resource measurements (_WRA Data Model_) and 
digital calibration certificates. Along with associated tools, these are intended as universal building blocks for 
wind energy yield assessment applications.

## Mission
_**"Our mission is to make the energy yield assessment process more efficient, transparent and reproducible 
through digitizing and automation."**_

## What is a "Data Model"?
A data model is an abstract model of real-world entities that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they 
relate to one another. In this instance, the _WRA Data Model_ standardizes how properties of a wind resource measurement station (e.g. 
latitude, longitude, anemometer serial number, installation height, logger slope, logger offset, etc.) are recorded and 
how all the properties relate to each other. An implementation of the data model therefore describes how a specific met mast was 
installed, how the sensors were mounted on that met mast, how these sensors were programmed into the logger and how 
all these properties may have changed over time.

For more information on the definition of a Data Model and other terminology such as Schema, please see the 
[Task 43 Glossary](https://iea-task-43.gitbook.io/iea-task-43-glossary/terms/data-model).

# The WRA Data Model

The _WRA Data Model_ provides the instructions for how to digitally represent the configuration of an installed met mast, lidar, sodar, 
floating lidar or solar measurement station. An implementation of the data model therefore can contain the latitude and 
longitude of where the met mast was installed. At what height is a wind speed measurement been made and by what 
sensor. How is this sensor mounted onto the mast. How the sensor is connected to the logger and how this logger channel
is programmed (i.e. what slope and offset values are programmed into the logger). And how all these properties 
may have changed over time.

To learn more about the _WRA Data Model_, please read Amit Bohara's 
[introduction](https://github.com/IEA-Task-43/digital_wra_data_standard/wiki/Task-43-WRA-Data-Model---An-introduction)
in the Wiki section of this GitHub repository.

JSON ([JavaScript Object Notation](https://www.json.org/)) is used to implement the _WRA Data Model_ and 
[JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) is used to express the _WRA Data Model_. The JSON Schema file, located at 
[./schema/iea43_wra_data_model.schema.json](./schema/iea43_wra_data_model.schema.json), is the 
_WRA Data Model_. It can be thought of as a blueprint for how an implementation of the data model can be described with 
the JSON data-interchange format. See Figure 1 below for a snippet of an example implementation.

The following tools are part of this undertaking:

- [WRA Data Model](./schema/iea43_wra_data_model.schema.json): This JSON Schema file is the _WRA Data Model_. It describes 
  how a JSON file that describes wind resource measurement data should be composed.

- [Documentation](./docs/README.md): Markdown documentation for the _WRA Data Model_ created directly from the JSON Schema.

- [Form App](https://iea-task-43.github.io/digital_wra_data_standard/): This app shows a form that is modeled after the 
  JSON Schema and can create JSON data out of your inputs that is in accordance with the _WRA Data Model_.

- [Python Data Model Loading Example](./tools/load_demo_schema.ipynb): This notebook shows how to read an example file that 
  uses the _WRA Data Model_ with Python. [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/IEA-Task-43/digital_wra_data_standard/master?filepath=.%2Ftools%2Fload_demo_schema.ipynb)

## Dissemination
The Task 43 team is actively working to disseminate information and improve user experience. 
The [Wiki](https://github.com/IEA-Task-43/digital_wra_data_standard/wiki) tab in this GitHub repository is the starting 
point to learn more via tutorials, recorded presentations, videos and more.

# The Digital Calibration Certificate Data Model

As a requirement resulting from the development of the _WRA Data Model_, a 
[digital calibration certificate](./digital_calibration_certificate) is introduced as a complementary standard. This 
standard currently supports anemometer calibration certificates according to IEC 61400-12-1:2017.
