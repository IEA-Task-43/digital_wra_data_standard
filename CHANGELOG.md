# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. If you make a notable change to the project, please add a line describing the change to the "unreleased" section. The maintainers will make an effort to keep the [Github Releases](https://github.com/IEA-Task-43/digital_wra_data_standard/releases) page up to date with this changelog. The format is based on [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) with the YYYY.MM tagged onto the end e.g. '0.1.0-2020.07'

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

    1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
    2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
    3. PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
