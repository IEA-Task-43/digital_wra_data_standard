For example a raw column name of 'Ch1_Avg' may be wired to an anemometer mounted at 80 m. However, half way through the campaign a 60 m anemometer was wired to 'Ch1_Avg' instead. An assembled data file using 'Ch1_Avg' as the column name would now have wind speeds from 80 m and then switching to 60 m. The analyst would need to split this column of data. Using the measurement point name instead when assembling the daily files will already account for this splitting and provide a data file with a column name, for example, of 'Wspd_80m'. This could be used by the analyst immediately without any further splitting and rejigging.\n",
